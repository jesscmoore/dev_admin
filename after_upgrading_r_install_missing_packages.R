# Input: This will use a list of installed packages that were saved as a character vector at 
# ~/installed_old.rda
# prior to the upgrade, using the script:
# before_upgrading_r_save_package_list.R


# Once youâ€™ve got the new version up and running, 
# reload the saved packages (still in R history file, and re-install all missing packages 
# from CRAN.
